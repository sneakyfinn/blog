# Story time

My interest in lockpicking came at an early age. Like many young deviants I was fascinated with the idea of outwitting a security system designed by someone more experienced than myself. And it would let me into places that I wasn't supposed to be. So like many others, I ordered my first kit from a catalog (remember those?), something akin to SouthOrd set:

Full of excitement and little knowledge, I tried my hand at a padlock, my house's door lock, and a cheap practice lock. At this point, I knew that you need a tensioner to put a rotating pressure on the cylinder and the pick to somehow manipulate the pins inside. Failing at setting individual pins I tried raking by jabbing the tool in and out rapidly while wildly torquing the tensioner. Over the course of a few days, I broke a few picks and grew frustrated. That cheap practice lock did end up opening on me if I jabbed a tool far enough into it - *much* later on I would discover that it was then that I stumbled upon my first bypass. After a while the kit went into a drawer to gather dust.

At some point I got a lockpick gun, just for the sheer coolness of it. That thing shredded pins into brass dust like no tomorrow but didn't open a single lock and it too was relegated to the dusty shelf. 

Watching a show about police and criminals I saw a mention of *bump keys* and, as before, wanted to try my hand at it. Ordering an extensive kit I went on a small rampage of damaging locks and not getting much further. Off to the storage it went.


# Why?

Why write any of this? The point is two fold:
- to organize my thoughts on things that interest me
- to help you avoid some of the mistakes I made
- to provide some learning that's hard to get in condensed form elsewhere

As you can see from above, my mistake was always looking for a shortcut. It was the next tool, the next techniques, the next approach. When things didn't work, I'd put them away. But the whole point of security is to deter efforts like those: surface level, passer-by attempts.

So, what if you find yourself in a similar position of wanting to learn lockpicking and are wondering where to start? Here's my advice:

  1. Start small. Pick a set with just the essential, but well made, picks, such as _TOOOL Necessary Nine Pickset_ available [here](https://toool.us/equipment.html)
  2. Get a good book on the subject **before** you dive into 1000 videos online. I am partial to [Deviant Ollam's work] (https://deviating.net/lockpicking/equipment.html) - *Practical Lock Picking* and *Keys to the Kingdom*.
  3. Either buy or make a set of progressive locks (e.g. 1-5 pins), and approach them like you would any challenge: one at a time, perfecting each step. It may seem trivial to pick a one or two pins lock but try doing it under different conditions and you will find yourself building that all important muscle memory.
  4. Resist the urge to buy further equipment. If you have a few hooks, a couple of rakes, a diamond, and at least two types of tensioners (top of keyway -  **TOK** and bottom of keyway - **BOK**) then you are set. Save your money and buy locks instead. 
  5. Speaking of buying locks, either go to thrift stores / second hand sales or make friends with your local locksmith. You don't need brand new locks at retail prices.
  6. Practice! Realize that this is going to take a while. It's worth it but it does take patience.


Next time, I'll go over some other learning tools and methods that helped me along the way.
