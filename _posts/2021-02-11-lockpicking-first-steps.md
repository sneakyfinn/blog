title: First steps in lockpicking
---

My interest in lockpicking came at an early age. Like many young deviants I was fascinated with the idea of outwitting a security system designed by someone more experienced than myself. And it would let me into places that I wasn't supposed to be. So like many others, I ordered my first kit from a catalogue (remember those?), something akin to SouthOrd set:

Full of excitement and little knowledge, I tried my hand at a padlock, my house's door lock, and a cheap practice lock. At this point, I knew that you need a tensioner to put a rotating pressure on the cylinder and the pick to somehow manipulate the pins inside. Failing at setting individual pins I tried raking by jabbing the tool in and out rapidly while wildly torquing the tensioner. Over the course of a few days, I broke a few picks and grew frustrated. That cheap practice lock did end up opening on me if I jabbed a tool far enough into it - *much* later on I would discover that it was then that I stumbled upon my first bypass.

The kit went into a drawer to gather dust. At some point I got a lockpick gun, just for the sheer coolness of it.
